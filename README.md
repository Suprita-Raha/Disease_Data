Disease-Symptom Analysis: Explore a dataset containing information about diseases and their associated symptoms to understand patterns and relationships between diseases.
Similarity Analysis: Determine which diseases share common symptoms and identify clusters of diseases based on symptom similarity.
Visualization: Create visualizations, such as bar graphs, to present the results of the analysis for easy interpretation.
Managerial Insights: Derive insights that can be valuable for healthcare professionals, researchers, and policymakers in understanding disease-symptom relationships and making informed decisions.
